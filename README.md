# MuzakMuncher
A fun project I wrote to scrape track information off of http://muzakwpn.muzak.com/

## Setup
Pretty simple. Expects you to have the latest Node.js LTS installed from https://nodejs.org/
Also expects a running MongoDB instance configured in `config/config.js`

```
git clone ...
cd MuzakMuncher
npm update
npm start
```
